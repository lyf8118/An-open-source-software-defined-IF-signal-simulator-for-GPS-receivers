Features
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This simulator is implemented in MATLAB to leverage easy-to-use feature of the interpreted language. 
The IF signal generation is driven by user-specified trajectory and real ephemeris data from IGS Rinex files. 
Configurable parameters are provided to set the characteristics of the IF samples, C⁄No, and front-end filter. 
The power spectral density and time-domain histogram of the generated IF signals are presented. The signals 
are further analysed and validated by a real software receiver. The results show the outputs of the receiver 
fit well with the configurations of the simulator. We expect this open-source simulator can offer researchers, 
students, and developers a useful tool for developing innovative algorithms with almost zero cost.
